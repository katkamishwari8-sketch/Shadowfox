This project implements a robust image classification pipeline designed to automatically tag images into predefined categories such as cat, dog, car,
and other object classes. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built using TensorFlow/PyTorch to perform feature extraction and 
multi-class classification with high accuracy.

The model is trained on a structured image dataset, incorporating data preprocessing, normalization, and optimization techniques to enhance generalization 
performance. The solution demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in computer vision and highlights its scalability for real-world deployments
such as automated media tagging, intelligent surveillance, e-commerce categorization, and AI-driven content management systems.

This project showcases end-to-end model development, including data preparation, architecture design, training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
